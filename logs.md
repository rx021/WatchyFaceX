- had to run 'arduino-cli lib install "Watchy"' // for Watchy.h

## 2025-0920 SAT
- fixed the watch again
- I think the screen might be frozen 
- when I plugin the device I can sse it with the arduino-cli
- and all I needed to do is open up the watch and disconnect then reconnect the battery
- so may it has something to do with the deep sleep mode?
- not sure ... 
- I'll have to think of ways to test this
