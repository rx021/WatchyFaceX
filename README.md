Experiments in creating watchy faces

---

## WATCHY SETUP:
- see: https://watchy.sqfmi.com/docs/getting-started/

```
## ARDUINO SETUP

Watchy comes pre-loaded with firmware that demonstrates all the basic features. You can also try different watch faces and examples in Arduino.
1. Download and install the latest Arduino IDE
2. Start Arduino and open File > Preferences.
3. Under Additional Board Manager URLs add:
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

4. Open Tools > Board > Boards Manager and install the latest version of esp32 by Espressif Systems. Check to make sure you did not install Arduino ESP32 Boards by mistake.
5. Under Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries, search for Watchy and install the latest version
6. Make sure all the dependencies are installed i.e. GxEPD2 , WiFiManager, rtc_pcf8563,etc.

## Enter Bootloader Mode

1. To upload new firmware/watchfaces to Watchy, you will need to enter bootloader mode
2. Plug in the USB on Watchy
3. Press and hold the top 2 buttons (Back & Up) for more than 4 seconds, then release the Back button first, before releasing the Up button
4. You should now see an ESP32S3 device enumerate a serial port i.e. COM, cu.*

## Uploading New Watchfaces/Firmware

1. Select the serial port for your Watchy
2. If you can't find the serial port, repeat steps above for entering bootloader mode. Also make sure you're using a USB data cable and not a charge-only cable. Try different USB ports as well.
3. Select Tools > Board > ESP32 Arduino > ESP32S3 Dev Module
4. Select Tools > Flash Size > 8MB (64Mb)
5. Select Tools > Partition Scheme > 8M with spiffs...
6. Leave everything else as default
7. Choose an example and click upload
8. After upload is complete, reset Watchy to run the new uploaded firmware

## How to reset Watchy

1. Press and hold the top 2 buttons (Back & Up) for more than 4 seconds, then release the Up button first, before releasing the Back button
2. Watchy should now reset, wait a few seconds for it to boot up and refresh the screen

## Wifi Setup

1. Click 'Setup Wifi' from main menu on the watch.
2. Connect to 'Watchy Ap' wifi from another device such as phone or computer / laptop.
3. Open 192.168.4.1 in the browser. (Note: on iphone this page will open automatically.)
4. Click 'Configure WiFi'
5. Enter SSID and password. (Note: SSID can be prefilled from the list of networks at the top of this screen)
6. Hit 'Save' button and wait for Watchy.
7. If connection fails, the watchy will display 'Setup failed & timed out!', otherwise it will display the local ip address and SSID of the connected network with confirmation.

### Troubleshoot Wifi Setup:

1. Click 'Info' from 192.168.4.1 page.
2. Check your router setting to make sure the listed mac address is allowed.
3. If there is still a problem, try clicking 'Erase Wifi Config' from the 'Info' page and wait for Watchy to restart itself. Then try the wifi setup again and it should hopefully work.

## SYSTEM SETUP: 
- Hardware: Framework Laptop 13 AMD Ryzen 5 7060
- Linux: Fedora 42 + Gnome desktop
- Arduino IDE 2.3.6 downloaded through ZIP file
    - see: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/


## SETUP ISSUES FIXED:

### ISSUE: Arduino IDE / system unable to recognize the Watchy in bootloader mode
- because of Linux Fedora 42
- SOLUTION:
    - need to load the kernel modules to enable USB-to-serial adapters 
        - cp210x
        - ch341
    - check to see if they are loaded on the kernel
        - `lsmod | grep cp210x`
        - `lsmod | grep ch341`
    - to load the kernel module
        - `sudo modprobe cp210x`
        - `sudo modprobe ch341`

### ISSUE: Board still not being recognized by the OS
- SOLUTION:
    - using a USB hub
    - OR using USB C connection to micro USB
    - what works even better is to have the wire detached until we need to upload
    - if it is already wired in then detach first then re-attach
    - also cycle through the menu 3 times
    - then go back to the menu screen
        - from there trigger bootloader mode when the board looks to be attached already

### ISSUE: permissions error when trying to upload the new watchface firmware
- because of Linux Fedora 42
- SOLUTION:
    - need to change permissions on the port when possible
    - `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0`
- full error message:
    ```
    WARNING: library Rtc_Pcf8563 claims to run on avr architecture(s) and may be incompatible with your current board which runs on esp32 architecture(s).

    Failed uploading: uploading error: exit status 2
    ```

- IMPROVED SOLUTION:
    - since the other one requires you change permissions each time it connects
    - we will create our own udev rule
        ```
        // in new file /etc/udev/rules.d/70-esp32.rules
        // may need to run sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/70-esp32.rules

        SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="303a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1001", TAG+="uaccess", MODE="0660"
        // - make sure to change `303a` to one that matches your vendor id
        // - make sure to change `1001` to one that matches your product id
        ```
    - to get your vendor and product IDs you need to connect to the board in bootloader mode and then run `lsusb` to find your new device



## ARDUINO CLI

TL;DR
```shell
// TO WATCH THE BOARD BE CONNECTED
watch -n 10 arduino-cli core list
watch -n 10 arduino-cli board list

// TO COMPILE
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32s3 .

// TO UPLOAD
arduino-cli upload -p /dev/cu.usbmodem101 --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32s3 .
```

### NOTES:
```shell
// TO WATCH THE BOARD BE CONNECTED
watch -n 10 arduino-cli core list
watch -n 10 arduino-cli board list

// TO GET FQBN
<!--arduino-cli board listall |grep atchy-->
arduino-cli board listall |grep esp32s3

arduino-cli config init

// TO COMPILE
// arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:watchy WatchyFaceX
// FAILING NEED TO RENAME THE FOLDER AS WELL AS THE .INO FILE
// BETTER COMMAND IF YOU ARE IN THE FOLDER
// arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:watchy .
// BETTER COMPILE
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32s3 .

// TO CHECK LIBRARIES INSTALLED
arduino-cli lib list

// TO UPLOAD
// arduino-cli upload -p /dev/cu.usbmodem101 --fqbn esp32:esp32:watchy .
// BETTER UPLOAD
arduino-cli upload -p /dev/cu.usbmodem101 --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32s3 .
```
- NOTE: had to install older esp32 core to match the IDE 
    `arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32@2.0.17`
- also had to install a bunch of other dependencies to make the compilation work
- installed each one that came up on the compilation errors
